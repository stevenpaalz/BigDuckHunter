# BigDuckHunter

## Background


## Functionality & MVPs

In Big Duck Hunter, users will be able to:

- View a gameplay area with flying birds of various types as well as obstacles that birds fly behind.
- Mouse over the gameplay area with a crosshair pointer to aim at different birds in the game. Users will be able to shoot the different birds in the game. Shooting a duck will award the user a single point, however shooting other types of birds will cause the player to immediately lose the game.
- Choose the level of difficulty of the game, which will change the flight speed and number of shootable birds.
- View a scoreboard and timer that displays the user's score. Running out of time will end the game for the user.

In addition, this project will include:
- Instructions on how to play the game.
- Mutable music and sound effects that will be played during the game.
